They raised their cups to their guests, reciting poems about the bright moon and singing verses about the bamboo hut. The moon rose from the eastern mountains, wandering between the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, casting its light across the river, making the water seem to touch the sky. It was as if a single reed could span the vastness, yet it was nothing compared to the boundless expanse. The moon floated like a ghostly ship, sailing through the endless sky, not knowing where it would stop; it drifted like a solitary figure, its feathers transformed, ascending to the heavens.

​	The wine was consumed, and they sang as they leaned against the boat's side. The song went: "The willow and the lotus, they beat the air, returning to the flowing river. The moon and the stars, they fill my heart, longing for a beautiful person in the vast sky." A guest played the bamboo flute, accompanying the song, his voice mournful, like a lament, a longing, a cry, a plea, lingering in the air, not ending like a thread. The song mourned the hidden creatures of the deep, and the lone boat's sorrowful wife.

​	Su Shi was moved and sat straight, asking the guest, "What is the reason for this?"

​	The guest replied: "The poem 'Moonlight and Stars,' 'The crane flies south, the willow weeps,' is this not the poetry of Cao Mengde? Looking west to Xiakou and east to Wuchang, the mountains and rivers are intertwined, the landscape is vast and gloomy. After breaking through Jingzhou, descending to Jiangling, flowing east, thousands of miles, flags and banners covering the sky, drinking wine by the river, reciting poetry with a long spear, a hero of the age, and now, where is he? Besides, I fish and hunt with you on the riverbank, sharing fish and shrimp, riding a small boat, carrying a basket, scattering the boat's shadow on the vast sea. I envy the long life of the Yangtze River, longing for its endlessness. Embracing the flying immortals, holding the moon, the end is long. Knowing that it cannot be grasped in a moment, I cherish the echoes in the sorrowful wind."

​	Su Shi said: "Do you also know the river and the moon? The past is like this, but it never goes; the full and empty, like that, but it never disappears. If you observe the changing, then the sky and earth could not exist in a single moment; if you observe the unchanging, then everything, including me, is infinite, and what is there to envy? Besides, in the world between heaven and earth, everything has its owner, if it's not mine, even a hair's breadth is not mine. Only the clear wind from the river and the moonlight in the mountains, when I hear it, it becomes sound; when I see it, it becomes color; it can be taken without restriction, used without exhaustion, it is the infinite treasure of the creator, and it is what my son and I share."

​	The guest was pleased and laughed, pouring more wine. The dishes were finished, the cups and plates were scattered, leaning against each other in the boat, not knowing that the eastern sky had turned white.
